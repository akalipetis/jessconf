Our conference is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience
for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual
orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity,
religion (or lack thereof), or technology choices. We do not tolerate harassment
of conference participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not
appropriate for any conference venue, including talks, Twitter and other online
media.

We follow the JSConf/Ada Initiative Code of Conduct. A full copy of this Code
is available on [confcodeofconduct.com](http://confcodeofconduct.com/).
